Acronym,Meaning,Description

AD,Advanced Design,"A group in PTD that helps interface between the rest of PTD and other design teams. They help negotiate design rules, design building blocks that are used by other design teams for products, and design test chips and other E-test structures, among other things."

ADM,Add/Drop/MRC Check,"A module recipe found in every modern recipe set. This checks whether mask data was added or dropped (i.e., spurious mask features were created, or actual mask features were destroyed) between PreOPC and MEC."

When examining these variations along just one edge it is called line edge roughness (LER, see above). LER becomes important for feature sizes on the order of 100 nm or less, and can become a significant source of linewidth control problems for features below 50 nm. LER is caused by a number of statistically fluctuating effects at these small dimensions such as shot noise (photon flux variations), statistical distributions of chemical species in the resist such as photoacid generators, the random walk nature of acid diffusion during chemical amplification, and the nonzero size of resist polymers being dissolved during development. It is unclear which process or processes dominate in their contribution to LER."""
